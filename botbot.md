# Deep Learning Overview 2024

Deep learning is a very powerful approach in machine learning that many people find confusing and difficult to understand especially when they first encounter it.

## What is Deep Learning.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns in data. Deep learning models can automatically learn features from raw data without manual feature engineering.

### Neural Networks

Neural networks are inspired by the human brain. A neural network is made up of layers of neurons that process information. Each neuron receives inputs, applies weights, and produces an output.

There are many types of neural networks including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks and transformers.

### Types of Deep Learning

Supervised learning is when models are trained on labeled data.
